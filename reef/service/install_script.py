"""Server-side rendering of the one-command harness install script.

``GET /reef/harness/install`` answers with a self-contained POSIX sh
script: the composition files ride inline as quoted heredocs, so running
the script makes no reef callback and carries no token. The binary's bytes
never come from reef: the script checks the locally installed binary
against the descriptor's pinned version and, only on absence or mismatch,
runs the vendor's own install command. Before writing, the script removes
the files a previous install's sidecar recorded that the new composition
lacks, exactly like the stdlib client pull, so installing an older version
never leaves a newer version's files behind. After writing, the script
verifies a sha256 over the sorted relative paths, byte lengths, and file
bytes against the value baked in at render time, and records the pulled
version in the same sidecar the stdlib client pull writes. Rerunning when
everything already matches writes nothing at all, not even the sidecar,
and says "already current".
