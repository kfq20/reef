    """Reproduces upstream OpenClaw-RL's binary-RL configuration on reef.

    The whole method runs server-side: the processor correlates main-turn
    records into sessions by preferring a harness-supplied session tag and
    falling back to trace matching, judges each turn by its next state against
    the PRM's sglang server, and batches judgments directly — no external
    grader. The step preparer then applies the verbatim upstream top-K select
    objective.

    Empty ``prm_url`` is correlate-only mode: sessions resolve, nothing
    trains, records stay compactable. ``batch_size`` must equal the slime
    driver's ``--global-batch-size`` (each turn-sample is its own rollout).
    Teacher scoring lives trainer-side: the Megatron teacher pass computes
    exact log-probs on the trainer's own tempered scale.
